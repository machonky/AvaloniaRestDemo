# AvaloniaRestDemo
Show how to use RestSharp &amp; Avalonia.

In the demo we demonstrate how to deal with CORS issues for Browser Cross-Platform issues. Check CORSDemo/Extensions and Program.cs

Also the App class uses some .NET Standard tooling for DI as well as some techniques to present facilities to the .Net IOC Container (App.axaml.cs) - ConfigureServices()

There is also some tricks on how to use appsettings.json in a cross platform way.

RestSharp is employed in the ApiClient - which is in turn used by a DataService which abstracts away the web stuff, so theoretically we can have mock data services for design time...Theoretically.

There's some design time issues to solve, but Runtime works just on Browser and Desktop.
